# burger

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).
... As well as HTML, CSS, JavaScript/jQuery.

<h2>Overview</h2>
Type the name of a burger you'd like to eat. Click the button and it'll appear in the "Options" portion of the page. Click "DEVOUR!" next to the burger you'd like to eat. From there, it'll show up on the other side of the page as devoured.

<h2>To-Do List</h2>
As of right now, only the posting functionality works. I'm still investigating how come the put functionality isn't working.
